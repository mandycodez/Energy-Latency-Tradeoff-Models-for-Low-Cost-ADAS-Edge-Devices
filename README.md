# Energy-Latency-Tradeoff-Models-for-Low-Cost-ADAS-Edge-Devices
Low-cost ADAS must meet strict latency for safety (frame-to-decision ≤ ~50–100 ms) without draining limited power budgets on embedded SoCs. Existing work optimises latency alone; energy per decision remains a first-class constraint in real deployments.
